## News

**2nd November 2020:** The paper was accepted at the IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2021.

**3rd November 2020:** Added visualizations for the ontologies presented in the paper.


## Ontologies

We provide different versions of the *Visual Event Ontologies (VisE-O)* and the *Ontologies* of the benchmark datasets.

**USAGE:** After opening an *Ontology*, the *Leaf Event Nodes* (blue), *Branch Event Nodes* (orange), and *Root Node* (yellow) as well as their *Relations* are displayed. By clicking on a specific *Event Node* additional information such as the *Wikidata ID* and related child (*Incoming*) and parent (*Outgoing*) nodes are shown. In addition, the search bar can be used to directly access a specific *Event Node*.


### VisE-O: Visual Event Ontology

In Section 3.2 of the paper, we have presented several methods to create an *Ontology* for newsworthy event types. Statistics are presented in Table 1 of the paper. Different version of the *Ontology* can be explored using the following links:
- **Initial Ontology** (result of Section 3.2.2): [link](https://tibhannover.github.io/VisE/VisE-O_initial/index.html)
- **Disambiguated Ontology** (result of Section 3.2.3): [link](https://tibhannover.github.io/VisE/VisE-O_disambiguated/index.html)
- **Refined Ontology** (result of Section 3.2.4): [link](https://tibhannover.github.io/VisE/VisE-O_refined/index.html)


### Benchmark Ontologies

In order to evaluate the presented ontology-diven approach on other benchmark datasets, we have manually linked classes of the *Web Images for Event Recognition (WIDER)*, *Social Event Dataset (SocEID)*, and the *Rare Event Dataset (RED)* to the *Wikidata* knowledge base according to Section 5.3.3. The resulting *Ontologies* for these datasets can be explored here:
